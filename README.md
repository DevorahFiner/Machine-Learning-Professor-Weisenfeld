# Course Syllabus – CS346 Machine Learning

**Instructor:** Daniel Wiesenfeld

## Course Description:

### **Goal**
My goal for this course is to teach you about **machine learning** in a way that balances a deep theoretical understanding of the material with the practical ability to apply these techniques in the real world. After completing this course, you should have enough hands-on skills to be able to immediately contribute to your team as an entry-level **data scientist**, while also having a deep enough understanding of underlying concepts to develop custom solutions to real-world problems that are always far messier than what you encounter in school.

### **Structure**
The first half of the course will focus on the fundamentals of **machine learning**. The primary way I intend to accomplish the aforementioned learning objectives is by having you code these algorithms **from scratch**. Yes, there are libraries that do all the things we will learn in class, but in my opinion, nothing can help solidify your comprehension and mastery of the material as much as hands-on, brains-on exercises. 

By “from scratch”, I mean without **scikit-learn** or any other library that abstracts away the algorithmic logic. Using basic **Python** with **NumPy**, **SciPy**, and **Pandas**, you will explicitly code and experiment with these algorithms. You will also use **scikit-learn** to compare the “store-bought” models with your “DIY” versions (and because you will almost certainly use **Scikit-learn** in real life, it’s good practice). It won’t be entirely from scratch. I will provide you with code stubs: **Jupyter notebooks** with some pre-written code and comments telling you where to write your own code and what it needs to do. You will be provided with tools to test your own code before submitting. After submission, I will test your code. If it works as intended, you get full credit. If it doesn’t work, you get no credit. So please make it work.

The second half of the course will focus on **deep learning**. We will purposefully go a bit shallower here and we will use more libraries and less from-scratch coding because, frankly, it starts to get much more complicated and computationally intense (though I do recommend you try this on your own and I can recommend some great guides for this). We will code up “simple” **Neural Networks** using **PyTorch**, learn some fundamental concepts, and learn to use **APIs**, which is becoming the standard way to do anything in AI.

We will not cover every algorithm out there, but you will hopefully learn enough that you can quickly and confidently self-teach additional algorithms and techniques as required in your jobs. You will not have to learn the mathematical proofs for each algorithm, but you will hopefully gain an intuitive and deep understanding of how and why each algorithm works.

## Prerequisites

This course will build upon the material that you have covered in previous courses such as **Data Mining**, **Statistics**, **Probability**, **Calculus**, **Linear Algebra**, and **programming**.

### **Programming:**
You are expected to be able to code in **Python**, including understanding how to import libraries and define functions and classes (with class methods and attributes). You should be familiar with the **NumPy**, **SciPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Scikit-learn** libraries. We will cover **PyTorch** and **Transformers** libraries, but you do not need to be familiar with them. We will use **Jupyter notebooks** extensively.

### **Probability & Statistics:**
You will need to know the concepts of **random variables** and **discrete and continuous distributions**, including **probability mass functions (PMF)**, **probability density functions (PDF)**, and **cumulative density functions (CDF)**. You should understand the concepts of **probability independence**, **joint probability**, **conditional probability**, and **marginal probability**.

### **Linear Algebra:**
You should understand basic notation and operations including **matrix** and **vector multiplication**, **vector norms**, and a conceptual understanding of **eigenvalues** and **eigenvectors**.

### **Calculus:**
You should be familiar with computing and understanding **derivatives**, especially **partial derivatives**, **gradients**, and **integrals**.
